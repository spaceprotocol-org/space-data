Space Program or Debris Program? 

Space debris is a global challenge. While the Commonwealth of Independent States ([#CIS](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fcis&trk=public_post-text)) leads with 17,155 debris pieces, a striking disparity emerges in its payload launches at approximately 3,678. This is surprisingly low considering associated debris count. This should raise questions about the correlation between space activities and debris generation. The United States ([#USA](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fusa&trk=public_post-text)) and the People's Republic of China ([#PRC](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fprc&trk=public_post-text)) have launched significantly more payloads than CIS. 

This discrepancy emphasizes the need for a nuanced understanding of space debris. Notably, France ([CNES](https://fr.linkedin.com/company/cnes?trk=public_post-text)), a key player in European space endeavours, is witnessing a growing debris problem with 1,056 pieces to its name. To resolve the debris problem, international collaboration, advanced debris removal technologies and a critical examination of the link between payload launches and space debris are crucial. A holistic approach is essential for a sustainable and secure orbital environment.
