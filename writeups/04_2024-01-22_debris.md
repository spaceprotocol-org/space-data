The growing [#spacedebris](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fspacedebris&trk=public_post-text) problem poses a significant threat to functional satellites in orbit and to future space missions. Debris in orbit is hard to track, so [#accountability](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Faccountability&trk=public_post-text) for everyone's actions is crucial in making space sustainable. 

To highlight the top polluters, we look at the bar chart visualizing the objects that have generated the most debris. In blue is the total number of debris pieces attributed to the object at the time of the event and orange represents the active pieces still in orbit. 

The Fengyun 1C (China National Space Administration) tops the charts as it generated the most debris when hit by an anti-satellite missile during a test by [#China](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fchina&trk=public_post-text), followed by the Cosmos/ Kosmos ([Roscosmos](https://www.linkedin.com/company/roscosmos?trk=public_post-text)) 1408 event due to a similar test carried out by [#Russia](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Frussia&trk=public_post-text). The debris generated from Cosmos/ Kosmos 2251 was due to an accidental collision with Iridium 33. Lastly, the Delta 1 ([NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nasa?trk=public_post-text)) and the CZ-6A ([China National Space Administration](https://cn.linkedin.com/company/china-national-space-administration?trk=public_post-text)) are rocket bodies that exploded in space. 

While this chart offers a snapshot of the debris problem, it's important to remember that the numbers may not be comprehensive as debris tracking and measurement techniques are still evolving. The chart only represents a small fraction of the debris population, as many smaller fragments may be undetectable with our current technology. The graph also doesn't showcase the spatial distribution of debris, which also plays a crucial role in estimating collision risks. 

This visual representation of the [#spacedebris](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fspacedebris&trk=public_post-text) issue should be a stark reminder of the urgency of the problem. We must collectively strive towards promoting [#internationalcollaboration](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Finternationalcollaboration&trk=public_post-text) to address the [#global](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fglobal&trk=public_post-text) nature of the space debris problem, raising public awareness about the dangers of space debris, and advocating for responsible space practices.
