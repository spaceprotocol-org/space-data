Space debris is a growing concern due to events like the collision of satellites and nuclear material released into Earth's atmosphere. Even ambitious projects like @Starlink's satellite constellations have sparked debate about responsible space practices and the long-term consequences of satellite proliferation. 

The graph below illustrates that intentional collisions, primarily resulting from anti-satellite weapons (ASAT) technology tests, have been the predominant factor in debris creation, followed by explosions of upper stages of rocket bodies caused by residual propellants to batteries.

Efforts to address space debris include guidelines and ratings for responsible space activities (@SSR), collision avoidance technologies, and sustainable satellite design. However, the lack of enforceable regulations and the sheer volume of existing debris pose challenges. International collaboration, innovation, and responsible space practices are essential to ensure sustainable use of outer space for future generations.
