Where does space debris come from? 
<br>Space debris is a growing concern due to its potentially devastating effects on the space ecosystem. Ambitious projects like [STARLINK](https://qa.linkedin.com/company/starlink?trk=public_post-text)'s satellite constellations have sparked debate about responsible space practices and the long-term consequences of satellite proliferation. 

How is space debris created in the first place? The graph below shows that among recorded fragmentation events, most debris has been generated by intentional fragmentation events (such as Fengyun-1C and Kosmos 1408) as part of anti-satellite (ASAT) missile system tests. Some debris was a result of unintentional explosions of upper stages of rocket bodies caused by residual propellants, batteries, etc. 

Efforts to address space debris include guidelines and ratings for responsible space activities ([Space Sustainability Rating](https://ch.linkedin.com/company/space-sustainability-rating?trk=public_post-text)), collision avoidance technologies, and sustainable satellite design. However, the lack of enforceable regulations and the sheer volume of existing debris pose challenges. International collaboration, innovation, and responsible space practices are essential to ensure sustainable use of outer space for future generations.
