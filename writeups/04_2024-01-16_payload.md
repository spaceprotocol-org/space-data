The 25-year rule for deorbiting satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) has been under scrutiny as concerns about space debris rise. While studies show 90% compliance with the rule reduces debris growth over 200 years from a staggering 330% to 110%, a further reduction to a 5-year deorbiting timeframe yields only a marginal improvement (100% growth). That raises questions about the rule's effectiveness and the path forward.

Experts argue that the issue lies not with the 25-year rule but in its enforcement. Estimates suggest global adherence is below 50%. That means most satellites remain in orbit long after their missions end, contributing disproportionately to the debris problem. The graphs below show the age distribution of satellites in LEO, and out of 9000 plus satellites, 1300+ are beyond the 25-year mark.

To tackle the debris issue, we must ensure a multifaceted approach beyond just revising the 25-year rule, including enhanced enforcement, technological advancements, responsible design and practices.
