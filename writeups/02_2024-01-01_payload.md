ðŸŒŒ Orbital Real Estate in Low Earth Orbit (LEO): A Call for Sustainability 

As we advance into the space age, LEO is becoming increasingly crowded with satellites and space debris, posing risks like potential collisions and interference with Earth-based operations. Congestion in highly sought after orbits highlights an urgent need for sustainable practices in orbital real estate management. 

It's crucial to adopt improved debris mitigation strategies, establish regulations for satellite operations, and enhance international cooperation. Let's work together to ensure that LEO remains a safe and viable environment for future generations and space endeavors.
