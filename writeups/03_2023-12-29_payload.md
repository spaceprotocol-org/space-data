Navigating Orbital Challenges: The 25-Year Rule and Aging Satellites 

In space exploration, the 25-year rule, a cornerstone of Post Mission Disposal (PMD), guides the responsible management of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). As the Canadian [Kepler Communications Inc.](https://ca.linkedin.com/company/kepler-communications-inc-?trk=public_post-text) satellites approach a remarkable quarter-century in orbit, concerns are arising about the potential impact of their extended presence after mission completion. 

The graph below shows the age of the largest satellite constellations in LEO. Some of them are new, but some are nearing the two-decade mark. While Keplers's enduring mission is a testament to space exploration achievements, the post-mission phase will pose many challenges. The 25-year rule is a focal point, prompting a reevaluation of guidelines for the responsible disposal of satellites that may linger as potential debris. International collaboration and innovative strategies are crucial to navigating this delicate balance and ensuring the sustainability of [#LEO](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fleo&trk=public_post-text).
