Navigating Orbital Challenges: The 25-Year Rule and Aging Satellites

In space exploration, the 25-year rule, a cornerstone of Postmission Disposal (PMD), guides the responsible management of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). As Canada's KEPLER satellites approach a remarkable quarter-century in orbit, concerns arise about the potential impact of their extended presence after mission completion on orbital debris guidelines.

The graph below shows the age of top satellite constellations in LEO. Some of them are new, but some are nearing the two-decade mark. @KEPLER's enduring mission is a testament to space exploration's achievements, but as these ageing satellites near the end of their operational life, the post-mission phase poses challenges. The 25-year rule becomes a focal point, prompting a reevaluation of guidelines for the responsible disposal of satellites that may linger as potential debris sources after their planned missions conclude. International collaboration and innovative strategies are crucial to navigating this delicate balance and ensuring the sustainability of #LEO.
