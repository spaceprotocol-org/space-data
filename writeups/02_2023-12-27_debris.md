The "dirtiest" orbits in LEO 

The escalating issue of space debris in Low Earth Orbit ([#LEO](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fleo&trk=public_post-text)) demands a methodical approach. While the whole field of orbital dynamics studies how objects move in orbits under varying influences from other bodies, a simplified view of the orbits occupied by man-made objects can be derived from: 

a) inclination: how much the orbital plane is tilted with respect to the equator and 
<br> 
b) periapsis: what is the closest the object gets to Earth while travelling in that plane 

While a simplified view, this provides useful insights into the distribution of objects in LEO. Some orbits are "dirtier" than others with the near-polar orbits (100 degrees) collecting the most debris. This may be due to various reasons including past collision and breakup events in this or nearby orbits, and the Earth's gravity pulling debris into "hotspots" orbits over time. 

Knowing which orbits to avoid is a critical step in launch planning and satellite lifetime operation. However, keeping an eye on trends in debris distribution is also the first step in taking the necessary clean up action that will ensure a safe and sustainable space environment for everyone.
