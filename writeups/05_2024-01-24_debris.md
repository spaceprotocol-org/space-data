A Gabbard diagram, named after its inventor, John Gabbard, is a visualization tool used in space debris analysis. It's a scatter plot that helps us understand the orbital characteristics of fragments resulting from a satellite or spacecraft breakup.

The image below is a Gabbard diagram of the infamous Fengyun 1C debris. The X-axis represents the orbital period of each debris fragment. Fragments with shorter periods orbit Earth faster, while those with longer periods take their time, and the Y-axis represents the Periapsis (closest point to Earth) and Apoapsis (farthest point from Earth) of each fragment plotted as two separate values for each fragment. The X-axis shows how fast each piece orbits Earth, and the Y-axis shows how close and far it gets.

The debris cloud formed by the #ASAT test destroying their ageing weather satellite Fengyun-1C, carried out by #PRC in 2007, created nearly 4000 debris, of which 2500 tracked debris are still in orbit.

By studying these patterns, we learn where the breakup happened, how spread out the pieces are, and how they might move over time. That helps us to calculate collision risks and predict the future behaviour of the debris cloud, ultimately protecting other satellites and keeping our orbiting playground safe.
