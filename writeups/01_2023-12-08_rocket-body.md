When will the rockets come back home? 

Until we invent teleportation, the only way to reach orbit is via rockets fired with enough fuel to place satellites at desired altitudes. While a single rocket can launch multiple satellites, there has been an underlying issue that is mostly not discussed. With every countdown to a rocket launch, another piece of space debris, a rocket body, is added to the junk orbiting the Earth, putting yet another object to be tracked and avoided by active satellites.

Traditionally, rocket bodies have followed a "launch and forget" model: they go up, but no active effort is made to bring them down. However, as space sustainability practices have gained traction, effective strategies to deal with rocket bodies have been considered, including reusable rockets like those from [SpaceX](https://www.linkedin.com/company/spacex?trk=public_post-text). As a result, the lifespan of rocket bodies, once measured in decades, is now rapidly decreasing. This is a positive development towards space safety and sustainability.
  
Not all is well, though. As the number of objects in orbit around the Earth increases, taking safety measures is indispensable for future missions. More defunct rockets, and more debris in general, mean more space junk constantly jeopardizing the safety of operational satellites. Even in the current not-so-crowded-yet space situation, Starlink satellites have had to perform over 25,000 maneuvers over a six-month period to avoid incoming debris. Space sustainability is far from a solved problem.
