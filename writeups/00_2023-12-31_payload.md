Starlink Art = No Stars? 

[SpaceX](https://www.linkedin.com/company/spacex?trk=public_post-text)'s [STARLINK](https://qa.linkedin.com/company/starlink?trk=public_post-text) has added more than five thousand internet-beaming satellites to the Low Earth Orbit ([#leo](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fleo&trk=public_post-text)), causing congestion and potential interference with astronomy. With plans to expand to 42,000 satellites, the once-sparse LEO has become dense and crowded. 

The image below represents the footprint of only 5588 [STARLINK](https://qa.linkedin.com/company/starlink?trk=public_post-text) satellites for one minute, which shows how congested the sky looks from below. 

Starlink's bright trails are causing problems for astronomers due to their interference with long exposures, resulting in unusable data and potentially groundbreaking discoveries getting hampered.
