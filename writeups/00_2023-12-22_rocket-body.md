Getting satellites to the right orbit in space requires tremendous [#rocket](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Frocket&trk=public_post-text) power ðŸš€ðŸš€. While [#satellites](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fsatellites&trk=public_post-text) in orbit do wonderfully useful things, spent rocket bodies just hang around and get in the way of others! They are among the largest pieces of [#spacedebris](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fspacedebris&trk=public_post-text) and are actively monitored to avoid collisions with active satellites. 

The current trend towards [#spacesafety](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fspacesafety&trk=public_post-text) and [#spacesustainability](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fspacesustainability&trk=public_post-text) has seen the use of reusable rockets, however the fate of rocket bodies currently in orbit is still uncertain and will require a massive and coordinated clean up effort to keep the space highways uncluttered.
