What services do satellites currently provide? 

Space based infrastructure is the backbone of the modern economy. The rapid growth of the space economy, set to hit $1 trillion by 2030, intensifies concerns about the escalating problem of space debris. The number of active satellites is predicted to triple in the next decade, along with the risk of collisions with existing satellites growing substantially, threatening crucial communication and navigation systems essential for the operation of the modern world. 

Most satellites in orbit provide communication ([STARLINK](https://qa.linkedin.com/company/starlink?trk=public_post-text), [Airbus OneWeb Satellites](https://www.linkedin.com/company/oneweb-satellites?trk=public_post-text)). The next most popular use case is earth observation ([Planet](https://www.linkedin.com/company/planet-labs?trk=public_post-text)) [Data source: [Union of Concerned Scientists](https://www.linkedin.com/company/union-of-concerned-scientists?trk=public_post-text) satellite database]. 

The unchecked accumulation of space debris will risk the functionality of such critical technologies, putting at risk the stability of nations heavily reliant on these systems for governance and societal order. Mitigating the risks associated with space debris is imperative for sustaining the growth of the space market and the uninterrupted operation of essential services.
