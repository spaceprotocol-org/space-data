The rapid growth of the space market, set to hit $1 trillion by 2030, intensifies concerns about the escalating problem of space debris. As the number of active satellites triples in the next decade, the risk of collisions with existing satellites grows substantially, threatening crucial communication and navigation systems essential for communication, climate monitoring and financial transactions.

The graph below shows that most satellites in orbit (according to the @UCS satellite database) are communication satellites. The unchecked accumulation of space debris may risk the functionality of such critical technologies, putting at risk the stability of nations heavily reliant on these systems for governance and societal order. Mitigating the risks associated with space debris is imperative for sustaining the growth of the space market and the uninterrupted operation of essential services.
