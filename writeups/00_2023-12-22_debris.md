Space or Minefield? 

The concentration of space debris is alarmingly high in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), with almost equal number of debris as payloads. The situation is also concerning in Geostationary Orbit (GEO), where debris can remain for extended periods. The high velocity of debris in LEO poses a severe threat to operational satellites, and international cooperation is critical to address this challenge. 

It is also essential to raise awareness among the public, scientists, policymakers like the [World Economic Forum](https://ch.linkedin.com/company/world-economic-forum?trk=public_post-text) and space enthusiasts about this dire problem. Although the [Space Sustainability Rating](https://ch.linkedin.com/company/space-sustainability-rating?trk=public_post-text) has added guidelines for the cause, we must advocate for responsible space practices and work together to clear the [#spacehighway](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fspacehighway&trk=public_post-text) for future generations. Our collective effort can ensure that the cosmos remains an inviting frontier for exploration. Let us embark on this journey responsibly to preserve the wonders of space for generations to come.
